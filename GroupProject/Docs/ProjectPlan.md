# Project Plan

**Author**: Team5a/Yechiel Kirschner/Pizon Shetu

## 1 Introduction

Our Application is a reminder app where you can create lists which you can add and remove reminders for your daily tasks
## 2 Process Description


**Communication** 
Description: How we are going to communicate and allocate workloads and manage the development of the app.
We decided to utilize SLACK as our form of communication where we will be discussing all our thoughts and plans for our app.
We also choose to utilize github as a form of chain to connected our work. To push and pull each other's work via git, and utilize individual branches for personal work. Once each member's work was peer-reviewed we would merge into MasterBackup this will be our main internal project and once the whole application is complete we merge the MasterBackup branch to Master branch for the final product.

**Front-end Design**
Description: The design and look of the application
The team will be working concurrently on all front-end design work, intial goal is to have a functional working app which can house all the function required such as Creating an list or adding a reminder to a list. The end goal is to have a robust user-friendly UI that allows users to traverse through activities with ease, which is also an minimalist approach where all functions can be easily accesible.

**Back-end Design**
Description: The construction of functions and activities of the application
The team will be working back-end implementaion lead by Vagner, in individual branches where our main intial goal is to have the basic functions working such as creating a list and storing that list so it is visible to the user. All work will be done using Android studio and JAVA. The end goal is to have a app that allows users to create, manage and personalize their daily reminders so it is easily accesible in our app.

**Construction of activities for the app**
Description: How will we manage the construction of the app and development
For construction and development Vagner, Amin, and Yechiel will be working together to construct early models of a working app that may implement few features which we wish to have in the final product such as Creating a list for reminders. We will be using Android Studio and Java(if needed) for contruction of our UserInterface. All work will be individually push in our group github in individual branches untill fully completed will be housed inside of MasterBackup.
